    "\n",
    "For our project we want to predict students who potentially might fail to graduate and who might need early intervention. To achieve this goal, we need to make a \"model\" which can predict if a students has a probability to fail. Our model needs to be initially trained and once trained, it will be able to make predictions. To train the model, we should feed the data that we have collected which we name it training data. This data contains different attributes about students like their school, sex, age, school size etc and if they have failed or not and we need to feed this data to our model for it to learn the pattern of how these attributes will lead to pass or fail. So, after the model is trained, the inputs will be the data which we have from the student and the output will be the chance or probability that he/she fails and based on that probability the model puts the student in one of the 2 existing groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model we have chosen after testing several different models is named Logistic Regression. This is a summary of how it works: Each of the data attributes for a student will have some contribution/effect on which group he/she belongs to. But different input atributes have different importance as of how much they can affect on the result. So for the training data as a whole, each input attribute will have certain amount of importance on how the model calculates the output. We name that improtance factor as \"weight\" for that attribute. Logistic Regression tries to learn the weight for each input attribute by looking at the training data. By getting the data for each student it tries to adjust its parameters which are those \"weights\". When it gets the data for all students in training data, the weights will be adjusted to some values which minimizes the number of incorrectly grouped students.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the training phase, once we have the weights for the model, our model is built and we can feed the new unseen data to our model and it calculates the output using the weights it has learned from training data. The nice thing about LR algorithm compared to some other learning algorithms is, it not only puts the students in different groups or classes, it can give us the chance or probability which they can fall in that group too.\n",
